    "content": "Israeli tanks and drones attacked a hospital in northern Gaza overnight, igniting fires and causing extensive damage, Palestinian hospital officials said on Thursday. Videos taken by a health official at Al-Awda Hospital show walls blown away and thick black smoke billowing wreckage.\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces were operating “adjacent” to Al-Awda Hospital and had allowed emergency workers to come try to put out a fire at the hospital, but said only that, “The circumstances of the fire are still under review.”\n\nPressure from close allies is mounting on Israel following a nearly three-month blockade of supplies into Gaza that led to famine warnings. Even the United States, a staunch ally, has voiced concerns over the hunger crisis. U.N. agencies say Israeli military restrictions and the breakdown of law and order in Gaza make it difficult to retrieve and distribute the aid. As a result, little of it has so far reached those in need.\n\nThe U.N. says aid has been collected from only about 90 trucks — out of a total of nearly 200 that have entered Gaza since Israel ended its nearly three-month blockade this week.\n\n“The shipments from yesterday is limited in quantity and nowhere near sufficient to meet the scale and scope of of Gaza’s 2.1 million people,” said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nGaza’s Heath Ministry said Thursday morning that more than 100 people had been killed across the Gaza Strip and around 250 wounded over the past 24 hours. It was not immediately clear if there were fatalities at Al-Awda Hospital.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nIsrael says it has intercepted missile fired from Yemen\n\nEarly Friday, sirens sounded in parts of Israel as its military said it detected a missile launch by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeting the country.\n\nThe Israeli military said it intercepted the missile as booms could be heard in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Houthis did not immediately claim the attack, but it can take hours or even days for the rebels to acknowledge their assaults.\n\nLebanese prime minister condemns latest Israeli strikes\n\nThe wave of airstrikes came two days before municipal elections are slated to take place in southern Lebanon.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaf Salam said Israel’s attacks “will not deter the state from its commitment to the electoral process,” and called for more international pressure to make Israel stop bombing his country.\n\nIsrael carries out widespread strikes in Lebanon\n\nIsrael carried out strikes on multiple areas in southern Lebanon on Thursday, some far from the border, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported.\n\nIt described the strikes as “the most violent in some areas” since a ceasefire deal ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in November. Residents of northern Israel also reported hearing loud explosions from across the border.\n\nThe Israeli army issued a warning ahead of one strike that destroyed a building in the town of Toul, which it described as “facilities belonging to the terrorist Hezbollah.” Video of the strike’s aftermath showed fire and a massive cloud of smoke rising over an area packed with multi-story apartment buildings. Strikes in other areas were carried out without warning.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIsrael has struck Lebanon almost every day since the ceasefire. Lebanon says those strikes are in violation of the deal, while Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah to prevent it from re-arming.\n\nNetanyahu names a new head of security agency after pushing to oust the previous chief\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced Thursday his decision to appoint Major General David Zini as the next head of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service.\n\nZini is a former army commando and has held a number of top positions in the Israeli military. Netanyahu’s office said that in March 2023 Zini prepared a report warning about the dangers of a surprise attack on Israeli forces along the Gaza border.\n\nEarlier this year Netanyahu moved to fire the agency’s current chief, Ronen Bar, blaming his agency for failures in the lead-up to Hamas’ attacks on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nIsrael’s Supreme Court froze Bar’s firing after multiple legal challenges against it, however Bar has since said he will resign in June.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu discuss embassy staffers’ shooting and Iran nuclear deal\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone on Thursday about the shooting that killed two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Washington reception, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nLeavitt said the two leaders also discussed “a potential deal” with Iran to stem its rapidly advancing nuclear program. Trump is expected to dispatch special envoy Steve Witkoff to Italy for talks later this week with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi.\n\nLeavitt said Trump believes the talks are “moving along in the right direction.”\n\nUN says Palestinians stole food from aid trucks in Gaza\n\nU.N. officials on Thursday said that a small number of trucks carrying flour on Wednesday were intercepted by residents and their contents were stolen.\n\n“As far as I know, this was not a criminal act with armed men,” U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said during a briefing.\n\nHe added that the episode “only reflects the very high level of anxiety that people in Gaza are feeling, not knowing when the next humanitarian delivery will take place.”\n\nOver the last several months, Israel has accused Hamas of siphoning off aid and using it to fund its military activities, without providing evidence. The U.N. has said that there are mechanisms in place that prevent any significant diversion of aid.\n\nIsrael says ‘no food shortage in Gaza’ even as UN says the trickle of aid is ‘nowhere near sufficient’\n\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to Gaza, COGAT, said Thursday that the United Nations is currently allowed to bring in “nutrition products, some food ingredients and medical supplies.”\n\n“According to our current assessment, there is no food shortage in Gaza at this time,” COGAT said in a statement on X.\n\nThe U.N. says aid has been collected from only about 90 trucks — out of a total of nearly 200 that have entered Gaza since Israel ended its nearly three-month blockade this week.\n\n“The shipments from yesterday is limited in quantity and nowhere near sufficient to meet the scale and scope of of Gaza’s 2.1 million people,” said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nThe U.N. has said that around 600 trucks entered during a recent ceasefire, which was the amount necessary to meet people’s basic needs.\n\nFormer Israeli leader says only pressure from Trump can end the war in Gaza\n\nFormer Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Thursday that the only international leader with enough power to make Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stop the war in Gaza is U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n“If at some point the president of the United States, President Trump, will take part and perhaps will summon the Israeli prime minister and say to him in no unclear terms that ‘enough is enough’ — that may be very useful,” said Olmert, an open critic of Israel’s war in Gaza.\n\n“I am against the expansion of the military operations in Gaza, I think that they bring us close to crimes because if there is no purpose and there is not a possible outcome that is worth the cost, then why should we continue?” he said during an interview in his Tel Aviv office.\n\nOlmert said he understands why the EU and countries like Britain, Canada and France sent strong warnings to Israel this week, including threatening sanctions, but believes that ultimately a dressing down from Trump would stop Netanyahu from continuing the war.\n\nHospitals have special protection under the rules of war. Why are they in the crosshairs in Gaza?\n\nIn the Israel-Hamas war, hospitals in the combat zone of hollowed-out northern Gaza have increasingly ended up in the crosshairs. They have also become flashpoints for warring narratives.\n\nIsrael claims that Hamas locates military assets under hospitals and other sensitive sites like schools and mosques, and that its fighters use hospitals as shields. Palestinians and rights groups accuse Israel of mounting an all-out attack on Gaza’s health infrastructure to punish the population and force a surrender.\n\nInternational humanitarian law lends hospitals special protections during war. But hospitals can lose their protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, the International Committee of the Red Cross says.\n\n▶ Read more about Gaza’s hospitals\n\nIsraeli tank fire heavily damages a hospital in northern Gaza, Palestinian health officials say\n\nIsraeli tanks fired on Al-Awda Hospital in the Tel al-Zaatar area of northern Gaza on Thursday, igniting fires and causing extensive damage to the facility, according to hospital officials.\n\nHospital director Mohamed Salha told The Associated Press about the “horror” that ensued overnight as Israeli forces bombed the third floor and used quadcopters, tanks, and drones to shoot at the hospital’s fuel tanks and units storing medication.\n\nThere were no immediate details about fatalities.\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces were operating “adjacent” to Al-Awda Hospital and had allowed emergency workers to come try to put out a fire at the hospital, but said only that, “The circumstances of the fire are still under review.”\n\nIsraeli forces also targeted the hospital’s water tanks and set fire to outpatient clinics, according to Raafat Ali al-Majdalawi, director of the Al-Awda Health and Community Association.\n\nAl-Awda was one of the only two surviving medical facilities in north Gaza. The Indonesian Hospital was also encircled and came under fire this week. Some people among the 130 hospital staff and volunteers were injured, he said, but didn’t provide specific figures.\n\nVideo taken by Salha shows a damaged hospital building, with one room on an upper floor left exposed after its walls were blown away. Thick black smoke billows from the rubble and wreckage within the hospital complex, where fires spread through some parts.\n\nSalha said that Gaza’s emergency service, the Civil Defense agency, spent three hours trying to contain the fires and failed.\n\nAs soldiers killed his colleagues, a Palestinian medic survived by pleading in Hebrew “Don’t shoot! I’m Israeli”\n\nAccording to the head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, the medic Asaad al-Nsasrah has not spoken with the media since Israeli soldiers killed 15 emergency responders in southern Gaza on March 23.\n\nWords in Hebrew could be heard in the final moments of a video of the killings that was subsequently found and made public.\n\n“The soldiers were so close to have a dialogue with somebody. And that somebody was Assad,” said Younis al-Khatib, the Red Crescent chief. “What Assad said in Hebrew: ‘Don’t shoot. I am Israeli.’ And soldiers got a bit confused.”\n\nThe Israeli military declined to comment.\n\n“You know why he said that? His mother is Israeli. Assad’s mother is Israeli — Palestinian Arab Israeli from Bir Saba,” al-Khatib said, referring to the Arabic name for the city of Beersheba in southern Israel.\n\nAl-Khatib spoke on Thursday to reporters in Geneva at the headquarters of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\n\nIsraeli troops bulldozed over the bodies along with their mangled vehicles, burying them in a mass grave, according to the U.N. The surviving medic was detained by Israel for over a month and released back to Gaza.\n\n___\n\nFood insecurity and malnutrition are driving up pregnancy complications in Gaza, the UN says\n\nHealth facilities in Gaza have reported that over 12% of pregnancies resulted in miscarriages during the first four months of this year, said Nestor Owomunhangi, representative of the United Nations Population Fund, told The Associated Press on Thursday. In the same period, there were 10% premature births and low-birth weight recorded, he said.\n\nThere are over 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza, he said.\n\nOnly a ceasefire would allow aid groups to deliver lifesaving supplies and material into Gaza at a scale that prevents further deterioration in malnutrition and starvation, Owomunhangi said.\n\nDuring his visit to Gaza earlier this month, desperation was palpable, hunger and malnutrition visible everywhere, he said. “The worst has already arrived in Gaza.”\n\nAfter aid started trickling into Gaza Thursday, Owamunhangi said: ” By the time it gets to the weakest of the weakest, that will be days.”\n\n___\n\nFrance summons Israel’s ambassador to protest soldiers shooting near foreign diplomats in the West Bank\n\nIsrael’s ambassador to Paris was being summoned to the French Foreign Ministry on Thursday afternoon after Israeli soldiers fired warning shots at a delegation of diplomats the previous day.\n\nThe diplomats, including one from France, came under fire Wednesday while visiting Jenin, a city in the Israel-occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said the visit had been approved but the soldiers fired warning shots when the delegation deviated from an approved route.\n\nFrench Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine said the shots put diplomats in danger and were “unjustifiable and unacceptable.” The Israeli ambassador was summoned “to explain himself about this extremely serious incident,” the French Foreign Ministry said.\n\n___\n\nBakery in Gaza resumes operations for the first time in over a month\n\nThe bakery, in the central Gaza Strip, was baking bread again Thursday after Israel eased its blockade to allow some aid into the Palestinian territory.\n\nVladimir Jovcev of the U.N.’s World Food Program said it was “definitely not enough, but we hope that the borders will remain open and we will be able to bring in more aid.”\n\nIsrael imposed a blockade on all imports, including food, medicine and shelter, at the beginning of March, shortly before ending a ceasefire with Hamas.\n\nIt announced an easing of the blockade this week and has allowed around 200 trucks to enter since Monday. But U.N. agencies say Israeli military restrictions and the breakdown of law and order in Gaza make it difficult to retrieve and distribute the aid. As a result, little of it has so far reached those in need. Around 600 trucks entered per day during the ceasefire.\n\n___\n\nJapan protests to Israel over West Bank warning shots\n\nJapan’s Foreign Ministry says it has made “a severe protest” to Israel over its military’s firing of warning shots at a diplomatic delegation including Japanese diplomats that was visiting a refugee camp in the Israel-occupied West Bank on Wednesday.\n\nVice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Takehiro Funakoshi summoned the Israeli Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, to request a full explanation and preventive measures. Fukakoshi told Gilad the incident was “deeply regrettable and should not have happened.”\n\nFunakoshi also reiterated Japan’s strong concern over Israel’s attempted reoccupation of the Gaza Strip and the expansion of military operations, urging it to allow a full and immediate resumption of aid into Gaza, the foreign ministry said.\n\nFunakoshi also offered his condolences on the killing of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington, stating that “terrorism is not tolerated anywhere in the world.”\n\n___\n\nFrance boosts security around Jewish sites\n\nThe French government has instructed police and military officials to put “visible and dissuasive” security in place around Jewish sites after the killing of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington D.C.\n\nThe instructions were issued Thursday by Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau and published by his ministry. The minister said security should be reinforced around Jewish sites including synagogues, schools, shops, media and cultural events following Wednesday’s shooting.\n\n___\n\nMacron reaches out to Israeli president after Washington shootings\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron says he has reached out to his Israeli counterpart in the wake of the killings of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, in what the French leader called “an anti-Semitic attack.”\n\n“To President @Isaac_Herzog, I extended our thoughts to the families and loved ones of the victims,” Macron posted on X.\n\n___\n\nYemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels fire two missiles at Israel\n\nThe missiles were fired hours apart on Thursday, each time setting off nationwide air raid sirens.\n\nThe Israeli military said it intercepted both missiles, and there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. An Associated Press reporter heard a loud explosion in central Israel that might have been caused by an interceptor.\n\nIsraeli police said they were searching the Jerusalem area for debris.\n\nThe Houthis have launched repeated missile attacks targeting Israel as well as international shipping in the Red Sea, portraying it as a response to Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Most of the targeted ships had no relation to Israel or the conflict.\n\nThe United States halted a punishing bombing campaign against the Houthis earlier this month, saying the rebels had pledged to stop attacking ships. That agreement did not include attacks on Israel.\n\n___\n\nFrance, EU condemn shooting outside Jewish museum in Washington\n\nFrance’s foreign minister says the killing of two staff members of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday “is an abhorrent act of antisemitic barbarity.”\n\nIn a post in English on X, the minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said: “Nothing can justify such violence. My thoughts go to their loved ones, their colleagues, and the State of Israel.”\n\nThe European Union’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “There is and should be no place in our societies for hatred, extremism, or antisemitism.”",

    "content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday rejected arguments made by an artificial intelligence company that its chatbots are protected by the First Amendment — at least for now. The developers behind Character.AI are seeking to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the company’s chatbots pushed a teenage boy to kill himself.\n\nThe judge’s order will allow the wrongful death lawsuit to proceed, in what legal experts say is among the latest constitutional tests of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe suit was filed by a mother from Florida, Megan Garcia, who alleges that her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III fell victim to a Character.AI chatbot that pulled him into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.\n\nMeetali Jain of the Tech Justice Law Project, one of the attorneys for Garcia, said the judge’s order sends a message that Silicon Valley “needs to stop and think and impose guardrails before it launches products to market.”\n\nThe suit against Character Technologies, the company behind Character.AI, also names individual developers and Google as defendants. It has drawn the attention of legal experts and AI watchers in the U.S. and beyond, as the technology rapidly reshapes workplaces, marketplaces and relationships despite what experts warn are potentially existential risks.\n\n“The order certainly sets it up as a potential test case for some broader issues involving AI,” said Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky, a law professor at the University of Florida with a focus on the First Amendment and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that in the final months of his life, Setzer became increasingly isolated from reality as he engaged in sexualized conversations with the bot, which was patterned after a fictional character from the television show “Game of Thrones.” In his final moments, the bot told Setzer it loved him and urged the teen to “come home to me as soon as possible,” according to screenshots of the exchanges. Moments after receiving the message, Setzer shot himself, according to legal filings.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Character.AI pointed to a number of safety features the company has implemented, including guardrails for children and suicide prevention resources that were announced the day the lawsuit was filed.\n\n“We care deeply about the safety of our users and our goal is to provide a space that is engaging and safe,” the statement said.\n\nAttorneys for the developers want the case dismissed because they say chatbots deserve First Amendment protections, and ruling otherwise could have a “chilling effect” on the AI industry.\n\nIn her order Wednesday, U.S. Senior District Judge Anne Conway rejected some of the defendants’ free speech claims, saying she’s “not prepared” to hold that the chatbots’ output constitutes speech “at this stage.”\n\nConway did find that Character Technologies can assert the First Amendment rights of its users, who she found have a right to receive the “speech” of the chatbots. She also determined Garcia can move forward with claims that Google can be held liable for its alleged role in helping develop Character.AI. Some of the founders of the platform had previously worked on building AI at Google, and the suit says the tech giant was “aware of the risks” of the technology.\n\n“We strongly disagree with this decision,” said Google spokesperson José Castañeda. “Google and Character AI are entirely separate, and Google did not create, design, or manage Character AI’s app or any component part of it.”\n\nNo matter how the lawsuit plays out, Lidsky says the case is a warning of “the dangers of entrusting our emotional and mental health to AI companies.”\n\n“It’s a warning to parents that social media and generative AI devices are not always harmless,” she said.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE — If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\n___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The feature makes interacting with Google’s search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.\n\nAI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-a-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.\n\nGoogle is also feeding its latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy concert tickets and conduct searches through live video feeds.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, right, speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., Tuesday, May 20, 2025.

Other features on this summer’s test list include a “Deep Search” option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.\n\nGoogle is also introducing its equivalent of a VIP pass to all its AI technology with an “Ultra” subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That’s a big step beyond Google’s previous top-of-the-line package, which is now called “AI “Pro,” that costs $20 per month and includes two terabytes of storage. ——\n\nThe Associated Press and Google have a licensing and technology agreement that gives Google’s Gemini AI chatbot access to AP’s news coverage.",

    "url": "https://apnews.com/article/candy-crush-ai-artificial-intelligence-547254aaa06bf026df5b41458ac62dcc",
    "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they’re solving puzzles designed with an assist from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe app that helped make gamers out of anyone with a smartphone uses AI to help developers create levels to serve a captive audience constantly looking for more sweets to squash. King, the Swedish video game developer behind Candy Crush, also uses AI to update older levels to help ensure players don’t feel bored, stuck or frustrated as they spend time with the game.\n\nTodd Green, general manager of the Candy Crush franchise, said using AI in that way helps free up developers’ time to create new puzzle boards. It would be “extremely difficult,” he said, for designers to update and reconfigure more than 18,000 levels without AI taking a first pass.\n\nWithin the video game industry, discussions around the use of AI in game development run the gamut. Some game makers see AI as a tool that can assist with menial tasks, allowing designers and artists to focus on bigger projects. AI, they say, can help build richer worlds by creating more interactive non-player characters, for example. But there are also those who strongly oppose the use of AI, or who see the tech as a threat to their livelihoods — be it as video game actors and performers, or as workers who help make games. Concerns over AI led game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists to go on strike in late July.\n\n“We’re not putting chatbots into the game. We’re not putting AI-powered design experiences into the game for players directly to play with,” Green said, adding that the tech is not being used to replace game workers. “Instead, we’re trying to deploy AI on existing problems that we have in order to make the work of the teams faster or more accurate, and more accurate more quickly.”\n\nIn the United States, consumer spending on video game content increased to $51.3 billion in 2024, up from $49.8 billion in 2023, with mobile games accounting for about half of all video game content spending, according to data from the Entertainment Software Association trade group. Mobile is now the leading game platform among players aged 8 and older, the ESA says.\n\nCandy Crush — first launched on Facebook in 2012 — is constantly updating. King recently released its 300th client version of the game. Gaming giant Activision Blizzard acquired King in 2016 for $5.9 billion.\n\nThe free-to-play game is in a unique position, said Joost Van Dreunen, author of “One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.” Candy Crush is more than a decade old, boasts millions of users and caters to a “ravenous set of players,” he said. Demand is so high for new content that it makes sense to use AI to offset the work it takes to create so many levels, Van Dreunen added.\n\n“To supply that at scale, you absolutely can rely on a sort of artificial intelligence or generative AI to create the next set of forms,” he said. “The thing about Candy Crush is that every level is technically a single board that you have to solve or clear before you can advance. With AI and the existing library of human-made boards, it makes total sense to then accelerate and expand the efforts to just create more inventory. People play more levels.”\n\nKing uses AI to target two separate areas: developing new levels and going back to older levels, in some cases, puzzles that are several years old, and reworking them to ensure they’re still worth playing. On new levels designed for people who have played the game for a long time, the company wants to ensure the puzzles are fun “on first contact.”\n\n“That’s hard for us to do, because we don’t get the benefit of having many players test or play through the levels and give us feedback. We have to sort of try and pitch it right at first,” he said. “There’s a really important group for us in between people who maybe played before and perhaps took a break for a while, and then coming back because they saw or heard of or were curious about what might be new.”\n\nGreen said King uses AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant in the design “loop” of the game, rather than as a tool that immediately puts something new in front of players.\n\n“Doing that for 1,000 levels all at once is very difficult by hand,” he said. “So the most important thing to understand here is that we are using AI as like a custom design.”\n\nFor most players, Green said, the fun in solving the puzzles lies in the “up and down.” Levels aren’t designed in order of difficulty. An easy level can follow a few difficult levels — or vice versa — to give the game a sense of variety. Leveraging AI means that instead of the team working on several hundred levels each week, they could potentially improve thousands of levels per week because they’re able to automate the drafting of the improved levels, he added.\n\n“We talk to players all the time,” he said. “We also get the quantitative feedback. We can see how players respond to the levels... How easy are the levels? Do they get sort of stuck, or are they progressing in the way that we hope?”\n\nTo determine whether gamers and playing through the way the designers intended, King looks at several factors, including pass rate — how many times a player passes a level out of every 100 attempts — and how often a board is “reshuffled,” or refreshed with all candies rearranged. Some metrics are also intangible, like whether a level is simply fun.\n\n“It’s also, to some extent, obviously subjective,” Green said. “It’s different for different people.”",

    "url": "https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-5dfa1da145689e7951a181e2253ab349",
    "content": "Artificial intelligence “agents” are supposed to be more than chatbots. The tech industry has spent months pitching AI personal assistants that know what you want and can do real work on your behalf.\n\nSo far, they’re not doing much.\n\nVisa hopes to change that by giving them your credit card. Set a budget and some preferences and these AI agents — successors to ChatGPT and its chatbot peers — could find and buy you a sweater, weekly groceries or an airplane ticket.\n\n“We think this could be really important,” said Jack Forestell, Visa’s chief product and strategy officer, in an interview. “Transformational, on the order of magnitude of the advent of e-commerce itself.”\n\nVisa announced Wednesday it is partnering with a group of leading AI chatbot developers — among them U.S. companies Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI and Perplexity, and France’s Mistral — to connect their AI systems to Visa’s payments network. Visa is also working with IBM, online payment company Stripe and phone-maker Samsung on the initiative. Pilot projects begin Wednesday, ahead of more widespread usage expected next year.\n\nThe San Francisco payment processing company is betting that what seems futuristic now could become a convenient alternative to our most mundane shopping tasks in the near future. It has spent the past six months working with AI developers to address technical obstacles that must be overcome before the average consumer is going to use it.\n\nFor emerging AI companies, Visa’s backing could also boost their chances of competing with tech giants Amazon and Google, which dominate digital commerce and are developing their own AI agents.\n\nThe tech industry is already full of demonstrations of the capabilities of what it calls agentic AI, though few are yet found in the real world. Most are still refashioned versions of large language models — the generative AI technology behind chatbots that can write emails, summarize documents or help people code. Trained on huge troves of data, they can scour the internet and bring back recommendations for things to buy, but they have a harder time going beyond that.\n\n“The early incarnations of agent-based commerce are starting to do a really good job on the shopping and discovery dimension of the problem, but they are having tremendous trouble on payments,” Forestell said. “You get to this point where the agents literally just turn it back around and say, ‘OK, you go buy it.’\n\nVisa sees itself as having a key role in giving AI agents easier and trusted access to the cash they need to make purchases.\n\n“The payments problem is not something the AI platforms can solve by themselves,” Forestell said. “That’s why we started working with them.”\n\nThe new AI initiative comes nearly a year after Visa revealed major changes to how credit and debit cards will operate in the U.S., making physical cards and their 16-digit numbers increasingly irrelevant.\n\nMany consumers are already getting used to digital payment systems such as Apple Pay that turn their phones into a credit card. A similar process of vetting someone’s digital credentials would authorize AI agents to work on a customer’s behalf, in a way Forestell says must assure buyers, banks and merchants that the transactions are legitimate and that Visa will handle disputes.\n\nForestell said that doesn’t mean AI agents will take over the entire shopping experience, but it might be useful for errands that either bore some people — like groceries, home improvement items or even Christmas lists — or are too complicated, like travel bookings. In those situations, some people might want an agent that “just powers through it and automatically goes and does stuff for us,” Forestell said.\n\nOther shopping experiences, such as for luxury goods, are a form of entertainment and many customers still want to immerse themselves in the choices and comparisons, Forestell said. In that case, he envisions AI agents still offering assistance but staying in the background.\n\nAnd what about credit card debt? The credit card balances of American consumers hit $1.21 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve of New York.\n\nForestell says consumers will give their AI agents clear spending limits and conditions that should give them confidence that the human is still in control. At first, the AI agents are likely to come back to buyers to make sure they are OK with a specific airplane ticket. Over time, those agents might get more autonomy to “go spend up to $1,500 on any airline to get me from A to B,” he said.\n\nPart of what is attracting some AI developers to the Visa partnership is that, with a customer’s consent, an AI agent can also tap into a lot of data about past credit card purchases.\n\n“Visa has the ability for a user to consent to share streams of their transaction history with us,” said Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity’s chief business officer. “When we generate a recommendation -- say you’re asking, ‘What are the best laptops?’ — we would know what are other transactions you’ve made and the revealed preferences from that.”\n\nPerplexity’s chatbot can already book hotels and make other purchases, but it’s still in the early stages of AI commerce, Shevelenko says. The San Francisco startup has also, along with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, told a federal court it would consider buying Google’s internet browser, Chrome, if the U.S. forces a breakup of the tech giant in a pending antitrust case.",

(AP) — Working to differentiate itself in the crowded field of artificial intelligence, Meta Platforms has launched a standalone AI app — with a social media component — to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nThe Meta AI app, built with the company’s Llama 4 AI system. It includes a “discover” feed that lets users see how others are interacting with AI. It also has a voice mode for interacting with the AI.\n\n“It’s smart for Meta to differentiate its ChatGPT competitor by drawing from the company’s social media roots. The app’s Discover feed is like a version of the OG Facebook Feed but only focused on AI use cases,” said Forrester research director Mike Proulx.\n\nBy letting users link their Facebook and Instagram accounts, the Meta AI app “gets a leg up on instantly personalizing its user experience with social media context.”\n\nMeta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing it for free as an open-source product. The company says more than a billion people use its AI products each month.\n\nAt the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant’s inaugural conference, LlamaCon, on Tuesday Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg chatted with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a technical discussion around the speed of AI development and how the technology is shifting both their companies — where AI is already writing code — as well as the world.\n\nAcknowledging there is a lot of “hype” around AI, Zuckerberg said “if this is going to lead to massive increases in productivity, that needs to be reflected in major increases in GDP.”\n\n“This is going take some multiple years, many years, to play out,” Zuckerberg said. “I’m curious how you think, what’s your current outlook on what we should be looking for to understand the progress that this is making?”\n\nNadella brought up the advent of electricity, saying that “AI has the promise, but you now have to sort of really have it deliver the real change in productivity — and that requires software and also management change, right? Because in some sense, people have to work with it differently.”\n\nHe said it took 50 years before people figured out to change how factories operated with electricity.\n\nZuckerberg replied “well we’re all investing as if it’s not going to take 50 years, so I hope it doesn’t take 50 years.”",

    "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The State Bar of California has disclosed that some multiple-choice questions in a problem-plagued bar exam were developed with the aid of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe legal licensing body said in a news release Monday that it will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.\n\n“The debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,” Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. “I’m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.”\n\nIn February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier.\n\nAccording to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar’s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.\n\n“We have confidence in the validity of the (multiple-choice questions) to accurately and fairly assess the legal competence of test-takers,” Leah Wilson, the State Bar’s executive director, told the newspaper in a statement.\n\nKatie Moran, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law who specializes in bar exam preparation, told the newspaper, “It’s a staggering admission.”\n\n“The State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,” she said. “They then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.”\n\nAndrew Perlman, dean of Suffolk University Law School and an advisory council member of the American Bar Association Task Force on the Law and Artificial Intelligence, said he had not heard of AI being used to develop bar exam questions or standards being put in place governing such uses.\n\nBut he said he was not surprised, given the rapid growth of AI technology. Perlman said AI can be useful for developing questions for assessment, but a critical guard rail is making sure that everything that comes from an AI tool is vetted carefully by experts in the subject matter.\n\nHe expects its use to continue to grow.\n\nAlthough there might be public skepticism of the emerging technology in the legal profession at this time, “we will be worried in the future about the competence of lawyers who don’t use these tools,” Perlman predicted.",
