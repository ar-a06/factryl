What exactly does AGI mean and how will we know when we‚Äôve achieved it? On Ian Explains, Ian Bremmer breaks down one of the most exciting (and terrifying) discussions happening in artificial intelligence right now: the race to build AGI, machines that don‚Äôt just mimic human thinking but match and then far surpass it. The idea of AGI is still a little hard to define. Some say it‚Äôs when a computer can accomplish any cognitive task a human can, others say it‚Äôs about transfer learning. Researchers have been predicting AGI‚Äôs arrival for decades, but lately, as new AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek become more and more powerful, there is a consensus that achieving true general intelligence in computers isn‚Äôt a matter of if, but when. And when it does arrive, they say it will transform almost everything about the way humans live their lives. But is society ready for the huge changes experts warn are only a few years away? What happens when the line between man and machine disappears altogether?\n\nKeep up with global news and why it matters.
